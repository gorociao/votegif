    <h2>Who made this?</h2>
    <p>Erica Gorochow, a design and animation director.  She is on twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/gorociao">@gorociao</a></p>

    <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
    <p>Voter turn out in the USA is notoriously low. Since deadlines to register to vote arenâ€™t federally standardized, it can be easy to accidentally miss the cut off. I personally think this is an acutely important election.</p>

    <h2>Who are you voting for?</h2>
    <p>This year, I am supporting the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, as well as other Democrats in my district.</p>

    <h2>I am voting for another candidate, can I share these?</h2>
    <p>Yes, of course.</p>

    <h2>Where did you get your info?</h2>
    <p>Deadlines via <a href="">Rock The Vote</a>.</p>

    <h2>Thanks to:</h2>
