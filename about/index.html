<div id="about">
    <h2>Who made this?</h2>
    <p>Erica Gorochow, a <a href="http://peprally.co">design and animation director</a>.  She is on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/gorociao">@gorociao</a></p>

    <h2>Why did you make this?</h2>
    <p>Voter turn out in the USA is notoriously low. Since deadlines to register to vote arenâ€™t federally standardized, it can be easy to accidentally miss the cut off. I'm frustrated by the the policies and politics of the last two years. This November is the clearest chance for Americans to make a change.</p>
    
    <h2>Wait, haven't I seen this project before?</h2>
